**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30988359](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.30988359)

**Abstract:** Radiolanthanides are important for cancer therapy and diagnostics but are challenging to chemically purify post production because of charge and ionic radii similarities. Conventional-scale ion exchange chromatography is commonly used, often requiring large volumes of costly resins, creating significant radioactive waste, and can be time-consuming. Microfluidic ion exchange separations can advance research and development using minimal resources to inform conventional column chromatography scale...

**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q-v2](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-b1m2q-v2)

**Abstract:** Efficient separation of f-elements is a critical challenge for a wide range of emerging technologies. The chemical similarity among these elements makes the development of selective solvent extraction reagents both slow and difficult. Here, we present a quasi-autonomous, AI-enabled workflow for the design and computational screening of selective extractant ligands. Molecular design is guided by SAFE-MolGen, a large language model-based agentic system that leverages curated extraction data to pro...

**Authors:** Ewa Rudnik

**Published:** 2026-01-02 | **Journal:** Molecules | **Citations:** 0 | **Access:** 🔓

**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules31010176](https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules31010176)

**Abstract:** Dysprosium is one of the most critical elements for global economies due to its essential role in the green energy transition. Although it is added in small quantities as an alloying element, dysprosium plays a crucial role in NdFeB magnets used in wind turbines and industrial motors. On the other hand, the limited resources and production capacity of dysprosium contribute to supply shortages and raise concerns about its long-term availability. Therefore, there is a need for efficient techniques...

**Abstract:** The deep sea—dark, vast, and still largely unknown—has become the latest frontier in humanity’s search for resources. As demand for critical metals such as cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements grows, industries are turning toward the ocean floor thousands of meters below the surface. Deep-sea mining (DSM) offers the promise of supporting renewable energy and green technologies, but it also raises urgent ecological and ethical concerns. This paper investigates DSM, its methods, its ecological ...

**Abstract:** Abstract This study analyses the dynamics of the global rare earth element market, with a focus on China’s dominant role as the primary supplier, which is crucial for the energy transition and digitalization. Using a game-theoretic approach, the research examines a potential duopoly market structure that may emerge over time, as well as potential shifts in supply from China to other countries in this scenario. It considers China’s low marginal costs and factors such as resource extraction and di...

**Abstract:** Abstract This work investigates the process–structure–property relationships in cobalt-free Alnico-3 permanent magnets fabricated using directed energy deposition (DED), a laser-based additive manufacturing technique. Systematic variation of laser power, scan speed, and powder mass flow rate is considered through the framework of global energy deposition (GED), a derived parameter that consolidates energy input across operating conditions. Microstructural characterization reveals that as-deposit...
