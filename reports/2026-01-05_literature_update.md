**Abstract:** Radiolanthanides are important for cancer therapy and diagnostics but are challenging to chemically purify post production because of charge and ionic radii similarities. Conventional-scale ion exchange chromatography is commonly used, often requiring large volumes of costly resins, creating significant radioactive waste, and can be time-consuming.

**Authors:** Pilla, Ganesh

**Published:** 2026-01-06 | **Journal:** Lirias (KU Leuven) | **Citations:** 0 | **Access:** 🔒

**Abstract:** Bauxite residue (BR), a red-colored waste material from the Bayer process used for alumina extraction, poses a significant environmental challenge due to its large-scale generation and storage. Over 160-170 million tons of BR are produced annually worldwide, with global stockpiles of this material exceeding 5 billion tons. These large quantities of BR are often stored in specially designed impoundments or tailing ponds, creating significant environmental risks, including contamination of surroun...

**Abstract:** Abstract Maize cultivation faces increasing risks from climate change, particularly because of increasing temperatures and extreme weather events. This study investigates whether the “hot” Earth system models (ESMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), whose past warming trends are typically greater than the observations, tend to overestimate future temperature and precipitation changes across the global maize harvesting areas. By applying an emergent constraint (EC) app...

**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18140315](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18140315)

**Abstract:** This paper outlines a radical epistemological rupture in contemporary economic theory, proposing a shift from an economy based on abstract values and virtual credit to a "Real Economic Metabolism" founded on physical reality and thermodynamics. Modern economy is built on the illusion that value is a financial concept detached from physical constraints.

**Abstract:** Pulses are an important part of vegetarians&amp;apos; diets because the other foods they eat don&amp;apos;t include much protein, and they are the main sources of various minerals, such as calcium, iron, phosphorus, and protein. The majority of the time, pulses are eaten as dehulled splits. The pulse processing is still restricted to time-consuming, health-harming, gender-biased traditional methods that assign all food preparation and processing duties to women.
