## Industry & Policy News

### U.S. Government Investment and Policy Actions

President Trump issued a Presidential Proclamation on January 14, 2026, addressing imports of processed critical minerals, finding that the U.S. is 100% net-import reliant for 12 critical minerals and 50% or greater net-import reliant for 29 critical minerals. The executive order emphasizes international cooperation to strengthen U.S. minerals security and addresses unsustainable price volatility and weakened domestic manufacturing capacity.

A $1.6 billion U.S. government investment package was announced, marking the largest federal intervention in the critical minerals sector since WWII. Federal investment in 2026 is expanding beyond rare earth elements to include other high-risk minerals like antimony and tungsten, with focus on processing technologies that break from traditional smelting methods.

### New Separation and Processing Facilities

**MP Materials** will begin commissioning its heavy rare earths separation plant at Mountain Pass in mid-2026, designed to process approximately 3,000 MT of feedstock per year and produce about 200 tons annually of dysprosium and terbium. This Pentagon-backed facility represents a major step in domestic heavy rare earth production.

**Ucore** is preparing for Louisiana 2026 heavy rare earth element processing and received conditional approval from the Government of Canada for up to $36.3M for Canadian rare earth processing.

**Aclara** is building separation facilities in Louisiana, and **REEtec's plant in Norway** is providing midstream separation capacity, demonstrating emerging capacity across allied economies.

### Rare Earth Recycling Scale-Up

**IonicRE and US Strategic Metals** signed a memorandum of understanding to develop vertically integrated rare earth production from recycling at a fully permitted 1,800-acre site in Missouri. This facility is expected to develop commercial recycling capacity for both neodymium-iron-boron and samarium-cobalt magnets, producing neodymium, praseodymium, and strategic heavy rare earths including dysprosium, terbium, samarium, gadolinium, and holmium.

**Cyclic Materials** announced a 150,000-square-foot facility in Mesa, Arizona, slated to start up in 2026.

**ReElement Technologies** stated that by the end of 2026, they'll be the largest producer of rare earth oxides in the United States, with a larger production site in Marion, Indiana coming online. ReElement uses large columns in a specialized filtration process developed at Purdue University to extract and purify metals from raw ore and recycled rare earths.

**Technology Advances**: Hydrogen Processing of Magnet Scrap (HPMS), originally developed at the University of Birmingham, uses hydrogen to break down and extract rare earth magnet alloy powders from end-of-life products without high-temperature smelting or acid-based leaching. Recycling rare earths requires up to 61.2% less CO₂ emissions compared to mining, yet less than 5% of rare earths are currently recycled despite 90%+ recovery potential.

### China's Export Control Policy Evolution

China has officially **suspended implementation** of rare earth export controls announced on October 9, 2025, for one year until November 10, 2026. The temporary suspension covers critical minerals including rare earths, lithium battery materials, gallium, germanium, antimony, tungsten, and graphite. However, the suspension applies only to the October 9 controls, not the previous round enforced in April 2025.

**Seven medium- and heavy-rare-earth elements remain under export control**: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium, along with their metals, oxides, alloys, compounds, mixtures, and magnet materials have not been suspended.

On **January 6, 2026**, China's Ministry of Commerce announced a ban on exports of dual-use items to Japan when intended for military use or uses that could enhance Japan's military capabilities, sharply constraining Japan's access to heavy rare earth elements. This represents an evolution from economic tool to diplomatic leverage.

China exercises near-total control over heavy rare earth separation, accounting for an estimated 90–95% of global rare earth processing.

### Critical Minerals Supply Chain Trends

Companies are expanding blockchain platforms throughout 2026 to additional rare earth oxides, battery materials, and defense-critical minerals to deliver traceability and compliance required by defense and government customers.

With growing competition for power from AI and data centres, the cost of electricity is becoming a defining pressure point for heavy industry in 2026, particularly affecting energy-intensive rare earth separation and processing operations.

A circular economy could create a second supply source for critical minerals used in clean energy technologies, with recycled critical minerals such as nickel, cobalt and lithium incurring around 80% less greenhouse gas emissions than primary materials from mining.

**Abstract:** The development of reliable luminescent nanothermometers for cryogenic applications is essential for advancing quantum technologies, superconducting systems, and other fields that require precise, high-spatial-resolution temperature monitoring. Lanthanide-doped systems are vastly employed to this purpose, and typically perform optimally at or above room temperature when manifold-to-manifold transitions are used. In this work we exploit individual Stark sublevels to demonstrate an optical Boltzma...

**Authors:** Sonu Kumar, Barbora Salajová, Andrej Kancko, Cinthia Antunes Corrêa, Shuvajit Halder, et al.

**Published:** 2026-01-19 | **Journal:** arXiv (Cornell University) | **Citations:** 0 | **Access:** 🔓

**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2601.13439](https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2601.13439)

**Abstract:** We report magnetic susceptibility, isothermal magnetization, and specific-heat measurements on the rare-earth hexaaluminate SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$, where Sm$^{3+}$ realizes a strongly quenched Kramers doublet on a triangular lattice with an exceptionally weak net exchange scale. The Curie--Weiss analysis yields strongly reduced ground-doublet $g$ factors, $g_{ab}\simeq 0.65$ and $g_{c}\simeq 0.70$. This indicates that the low-temperature response is governed primarily by single-ion physics, with ...
