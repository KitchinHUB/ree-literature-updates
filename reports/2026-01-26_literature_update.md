**Abstract:** Proteins offer a molecular design space to create bespoke ligands for the separation of critical metals, like rare earth elements (REs). However, data-intensive approaches to fine-tune metalloprotein selectivity are bottlenecked by the low-throughput nature of existing characterization methods. Here we invented an assay called "SpyTag-Catcher Immobilization of Lanmodulin for Assaying Metal-Binding Selectivity" (SpyCI-LAMBS) to measure metalloprotein selectivity en masse. This 96-format workflow ...

**Abstract:** The separation of rare earth elements (REEs) with similar chemical properties remains a relevant challenge today, most often addressed using liquid–liquid and solid-phase extraction with various chelating agents. Excellent complexing agents for REEs are 1,3-diketones and their analogs. We have for the first time proposed a method for preparing a material consisting of a covalently immobilized 3-acyl-4-hydroxycoumarin ligand on silica. For its synthesis, we employed a strategy based on the “click...

**Abstract:** Gas hydrate-bearing sediments are highly sensitive to redox fluctuations, primarily driven by methane fluxes associated with gas hydrate decomposition or cold seep activity. These sediments serve as valuable archives, preserving records of past redox states and methane emission events. Trace elements and rare earth elements (REE) have been widely applied as proxies to reconstruct such environmental conditions. Anoxic, methane-rich depositional environments characteristic of gas hydrate systems p...

**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.3390/su18021084](https://doi.org/10.3390/su18021084)

**Abstract:** Critical mineral supply chains underpin electric mobility, power electronics, clean hydrogen, and advanced manufacturing. Drawing on the resource-based view (RBV), the relational view, and dynamic capabilities, we conceptualize advantage not as ownership of ore bodies but as orchestration of multi-tier resource systems: upstream access, midstream processing know-how, standards and permits, and durable inter-organizational ties. In a world of high concentration at key stages (refining, separation...

**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.3390/min16010112](https://doi.org/10.3390/min16010112)

**Abstract:** The Weishan rare earth element (REE) deposit, located in western Shandong, North China Block, is a typical carbonatite REE deposit and constitutes the third largest light REE resource in China. Its mineralization is closely related to the multi-stage evolution of a carbonatite magma–hydrothermal system. However, the mechanisms governing REE enrichment, migration, and precipitation remain insufficiently constrained from a mineralogical perspective, which hampers the understanding of the ore-formi...

**Published:** 2026-01-19 | **Journal:** arXiv (Cornell University) | **Citations:** 0 | **Access:** 🔓

**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2601.13439](https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2601.13439)

**Abstract:** We report magnetic susceptibility, isothermal magnetization, and specific-heat measurements on the rare-earth hexaaluminate SmMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$, where Sm$^{3+}$ realizes a strongly quenched Kramers doublet on a triangular lattice with an exceptionally weak net exchange scale. The Curie--Weiss analysis yields strongly reduced ground-doublet $g$ factors, $g_{ab}\simeq 0.65$ and $g_{c}\simeq 0.70$. This indicates that the low-temperature response is governed primarily by single-ion physics, with ...
