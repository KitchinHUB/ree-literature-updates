### China Export Policy Updates

**Temporary Suspension of October 2025 Controls**
- China suspended implementation of rare earth export controls announced on October 9, 2025, for one year until November 10, 2026
- Covers critical minerals including rare earths, lithium battery materials, gallium, germanium, antimony, tungsten, and graphite
- **Important**: Previous controls from April 2025 remain in effect, covering seven medium- and heavy-rare-earth elements (samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, yttrium)

**Japan-Specific Restrictions**
- On January 6, 2026, China tightened export controls on dual-use items bound for Japan, sharply constraining access to heavy rare earth elements
- Led to a 14.52% single-day jump in Lynas Rare Earths shares on January 7

### U.S. Policy Actions

**Presidential Proclamation on Critical Minerals (January 14, 2026)**
- President Trump issued a proclamation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act
- Addresses imports of processed critical minerals
- U.S. is 100% net-import reliant for 12 critical minerals and 50%+ reliant for 29 critical minerals
- Sources: [Adjusting Imports of Processed Critical Minerals](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2026/01/adjusting-imports-of-processed-critical-minerals-and-their-derivative-products-into-the-united-states/), [U.S. Trade Proclamation Reinforces Importance of Domestic Rare Earths Supply Chain](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/01/21/3223018/0/en/U-S-Trade-Proclamation-Reinforces-Importance-of-Domestic-Rare-Earths-Supply-Chain.html)

**Treasury Finance Ministerial (January 12, 2026)**
- Secretary Bessent convened Finance Ministers to discuss securing and diversifying critical minerals supply chains

### Market Context

**Processing Bottleneck Remains**
- China exercises near-total control over heavy rare earth separation, accounting for 90-95% of global rare earth processing
- Processing remains the industry's central bottleneck and China's strongest lever
- Less than 5% of rare earths are currently recycled despite 90%+ recovery potential
- Sources: [The Burn and the Choke](https://warontherocks.com/2026/01/the-burn-and-the-choke-why-semiconductor-controls-will-outlast-chinas-rare-earth-weapon/), [Recycling REEs for rare earth magnets](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/powering-the-energy-transitions-motor-circular-rare-earth-elements)

**Environmental Benefits of Recycling**
- Recycled critical minerals incur, on average, around 80% less greenhouse gas emissions than primary materials from mining
- Circular economy approach could create a second supply source for critical minerals
- Sources: [Clean energy supply chains need a circular economy](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2026/01/circular-economy-clean-energy-supply-chain-critical-minerals/), [How 2026 will reshape US critical minerals resilience](https://www.mining.com/how-2026-will-reshape-the-us-critical-mineral-resilience/)
