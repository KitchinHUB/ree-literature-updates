**Abstract:** To reduce reliance on foreign nations, it is essential for the United States to identify domestic sources of rare earth elements (REEs) and develop sustainable technologies to effectively recover them. Acid mine drainage (AMD) is one such source that has attracted interest because of the presence of a wide range of REEs. The concentration of REEs in these sources is, however, dilute (at the ppb level), and while conventional processes, such as solvent extraction, effectively recover them, they a...
