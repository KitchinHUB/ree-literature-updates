**Abstract:** Cu is extensively used across various fields due to its excellent electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and machinability. However, it is prone to corrosion and biofouling in humid and contaminated environments, limiting its performance and durability. Herein, we report a Ce<sup>3+</sup>-driven electrooxidation method to construct uniform and dense Cu-Ce-O nanorods on ultrathin Cu foil (∼8.7 μm), achieving superhydrophobicity after subsequent fluorination. The incorporation of Ce salts ...

**Abstract:** ABSTRACT With the development of fluorinated waste treatment and the extraction of metals such as rare earths, high‐density F − wastewater becomes a potential threat. Compared to inorganic adsorbents for F − removal with high cost due to agglomeration, this paper firstly utilizes maleic anhydride to control pH and achieves cross‐linked PVA/PVP as polymer matrix and in situ synthesized Al(OH) 3 (ATH) as inorganic particles simultaneously, and obtains cross‐linked ATH/PVA/PVP composite films with ...

**Abstract:** Rare Earth Elements (REE) are critical minerals for the global energy transition and for fulfilling Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as SDG 7 (Clean Energy). However, the traditional supply chain, focused on primary deposits, faces significant geopolitical and environmental challenges. In this context, ion-adsorption clay (IAC) deposits have emerged as the main research route for a more sustainable REE production, aligned with the 2030 Agenda. Despite this relevance, there has been no ...

**Authors:** Buchan Zhou, Sheng Zhang, Wenyuan Zhao, Jie Xiao, Ming Chen

**Published:** 2026-01-06 | **Journal:** Environmental Reviews | **Citations:** 0 | **Access:** 🔒

**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1139/er-2025-0194](https://doi.org/10.1139/er-2025-0194)

**Abstract:** The large-scale extraction of ion-adsorption rare earth minerals in southern China has led to severe ecological degradation. This degradation is characterized by soil acidification, accumulation of rare earth elements and associated metals, ammonia nitrogen pollution, and oligotrophication, creating combined stresses that hinder restoration. This review systematically summarizes the pollution characteristics and ecological risks of such mining areas, evaluating various single remediation approac...

### 2. Engineering ductility in magnesium: A review of texture-driven challenges and opportunities

**Authors:** Emma L. Podd, David M. Collins

**Published:** 2026-01-06 | **Journal:** Materials Science and Technology | **Citations:** 0 | **Access:** 🔓

**DOI:** [https://doi.org/10.1177/02670836251412242](https://doi.org/10.1177/02670836251412242)

**Abstract:** Magnesium and its alloys are increasingly used in automotive and aerospace industries due to their low density, which supports lightweighting and reduces environmental impact. However, their broader application is limited by poor formability, largely resulting from strong textures formed during mechanical processing that reduce ductility. Extensive research has focused on mitigating this issue through alloying and optimised processing. While rare earth (RE) elements are highly effective in weake...
